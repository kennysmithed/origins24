The first tutorial will be hands-on, to give you a chance to check your understanding of the basics of the comparative method and evolution by natural selection. 

## Phylogenetic trees

Using the [Evolution Lab game](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs/lab/evolution/) (click "play game"), complete at least the three training trees (Red, green and gecko; Familiar faces; Tree of life: Vegetarian edition). The aim here is to understand why closely related species might be expected to share many traits, and how patterns of shared and differing traits between organisms can be informative about evolutionary history of traits and species (e.g. the patterns of relatedness between species, and when certain traits are likely to have evolved). 

# Evolution by natural selection

Use [the AlleleA1 web app](https://faculty.washington.edu/herronjc/a1/) to answer the questions below. The aim here is to get a basic understanding of the effects of selection and also genetic drift (changes in gene frequency driven by chance). 

The AlleleA1 app allows you to simulate evolution of a single gene in an imaginary population of organisms. There are two possible genetic variants, called A1 and A2; each has two parents and inherits a variant from each, so an individual might be characterised as A1A1 (inherits the A1 variant from both parents), A1A2 (inherits the A1 variant from one parent and the A2 variant from the other), or A2A2 (inherits the A2 variant from both parents). The app allows you to manipulate selection in favour of each possible genotype, by manipulating the relative fitness of each combination of genetic variants. By default the app starts with all genotypes having equal fitness (they all have relative fitness of 1), and it plots the frequency of A1 variants in an infinitely large population for 50 generations of evolution; in this scenario, no gene frequencies every change, so the plot is a very boring straight line.

- By messing with the selection parameters, can you find settings where A1 takes over the population (i.e. the line moves to Frequency of Allele A1 close to 1) or dies out (i.e. the line moves to Frequency of Allele A1 close to 0)? What affects the speed with which this happens? You might want to change to plotting more than 50 generations to see what is happening.

- Things get more interesting if you move from looking at infinitely large populations (where the maths is very neat) to populations of a finite size (i.e. where there are a set number of individuals at each generation). You can change this by changing the parameter "Number of finite populations to simulate" to some number other than 0 - e.g. if you set it to 5, it will simulate 5 populations for you, each of 100 individuals (and you control the population size in the next box in the app), and the graph will plot one line per population; you can click "run again" to rerun the simulations, it will be different every time because these involve a random component for who lives, dies and reproduces. Reset the app to the default parameters (button in the top right) and then simulate 5 populations where all variants have equal fitness. What happens, and why? What happens if you change the population size to very small (e.g. 10 individuals) or very large (e.g. 1000)? What if you change the selection parameters as you did before - does the fittest variant always win?
