title: Week 5 tutorial briefing
description: Studying the cultural evolution of song in birds
---

This week's reading was about vocal learning, and in the lecture I focussed on grammar learning. The tutorial exercise this week picks up on both topics, and since it's so interesting we'll return to a related topic next week. 

For this week's tutorial, read [Fehér et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07994) and [Fehér et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0053) - they are both very short!
