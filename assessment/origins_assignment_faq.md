## Have you got any examples we could look at?

Yes! Here are two strong essays from an earlier version of the course, plus the marker notes. I have made redactions so you can't see the student names. [Example 1](ExampleEssay1.pdf) is an essay on a set topic that we are not using this year. [Example 2](ExampleEssay2.pdf) is an essay on a topic the student came up with themselves, which was approved by me (i.e. this was the 2nd essay for a Masters student). *Do not write an essay on either of these topics* - neither are on our list of set topics, and for Masters students I won't approve these as self-designed topics for assignment 2. The marks they got, plus the marker annotations, are at the end. 

## Do I have to use a certain font, margin width, or line spacing?

No, just pick something that is readable for us!
