title: Week 3 tutorial briefing
description: Homologies in gestural communication?
---

In this week's lecture and associated readings we have been looking at animal communication - the gap between their rich mental lives and what their communication system allows them to express, but also some interesting features of animal communication that appear to share important features with human language (in particular, intentionality and structure). For this tutorial we will look at animal communication from a different perspective, reading [Graham & Hobaiter (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001939), which describes an experiment investigating comprehension of ape gestures by humans (if you are interested in reading about production of ape-like gestures by young children, optionally check out [Kersken et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-018-1213-z)).
