title: Week 9 pre-lecture reading
description: Gene-culture co-evolution
---

In this final lecture, I am going to talk about gene-culture co-evolution, and how it relates to language. The reading for this week is [Smith (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12377), which is a review paper I wrote with this lecture in mind! 

## The main idea

The main idea behind gene-culture coevolution is that genetic and cultural evolution interact with each other: culturally-transmitted behaviours (like farming, tool use, urban living or language) create selection pressures which drive genetic evolution, and that genetic evolution sets the scene for further cultural evolution. We already came across this idea in relation to the Morgan et al. (2015) paper on the co-evolution of language and tool use. The idea in that paper is that the use of stone tools (a socially-learned behaviour) generated a selection pressure for enhanced social learning or language abilities (because this facilitates the learning and transmission of stone tool technologies); natural selection responded by selecting for genes which produced individuals with improved social learning/communicative abilities; the enhanced cognitive/communicative abilities produced by natural selection then set the stage for the development of more complex technologies (again via social learning), which in turn increased the selection pressure for genes encoding more sophisticated language/teaching abilities, and so on. This is a classic (hypothetical) case of gene-culture co-evolution: genetic and cultural evolution feed back on one another, each driving on changes in the other.

While this case involving language is rather speculative, there are a number of better-evidenced cases of gene-culture co-evolution, including classic work on how the cultural practice of dairying generates selection pressure for genes allowing individuals to consume milk into adulthood, and how cooking might have changed selection pressures on human facial musculature (basically if you cook your food you don't need to chew it as much). 

For me, the most exciting idea in the gene-culture co-evolution literature  is that humans have undergone rapid evolution in the recent past (and therefore probably in the present day), as a result of environments *we ourselves have created* through culturally-transmitted behaviours including agriculture, our social systems, and maybe language. I think a lot of people have the intuition that biological evolution is basically finished in humans, because we can insulate ourselves from the environment through culturally-transmitted skills, behaviours and technologies (sometimes called counteractive niche construction); but the exciting thing is that exactly the same processes generate new selection pressures, as we create new environments which our must genes adapt to (sometimes called inceptive niche construction).
