This week's tutorial picks up on a topics we discussed last week, on the grammar learning capacities of non-humans. In this tutorial you'll read and discuss [Truswell (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/mila.12150), which is a short critique of a well-known monkey artificial grammar learning experiment, plus an interesting analysis of the comprehension abilities of a language-trained ape. 

**Discussion points to follow**
